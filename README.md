# React Lite YouTube Embed

> üì∫ A faster and cleaner YouTube embed component for __React__: 1.4kB minified, 699B minified + gzipped

Port of Paul Irish's [Lite YouTube Embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) to a React Component. Provide videos with a supercharged focus on visual performance. The gain is not the same as the web component of the original implementation but saves some requests and gives you more control of the embed visual. An ["Adaptive Loading"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puUPpVrIRkc) way to handle iframes for YouTube.

       adNetwork={true} // Default true, to preconnect or not to doubleclick addresses called by YouTube iframe (the adnetwork from Google)
       playlist={false} // Use  true when your ID be from a playlist

Default value for this prop is "hqdefault". Please be aware that "sddefault" and "maxresdefault", high resolution images are not always avaialble for every video.

    />
  </div>

```

## Bring Your Own Styles

React Lite YouTube Embed is packaged with all original styles from Paul Irish's [Lite YouTube Embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) but you can customize them as you wish passing as a props.

```javascript
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <LiteYouTubeEmbed
       id="L2vS_050c-M"
       activeClass="lyt-activated" // Default as "lyt-activated", gives control to wrapper once clicked
       iframeClass="" // Default none, gives control to add a class to iframe element itself
       playerClass="lty-playbtn" // Default as "lty-playbtn" to control player button styles
       wrapperClass="yt-lite" // Default as "yt-lite" for the div wrapping the area, it is the most important class and needs extra attention, please refer to LiteYouTubeEmbed.css for a reference.
    />
  </div>
);
```
